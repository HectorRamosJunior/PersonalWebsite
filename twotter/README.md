# Twotter
Personal MVP Implementation of a Twitter inspired website

Still in progress!

Site handles twoots, retwoots, favorites, and displays notifications from other users. Next is adding a user search feature and allowing users to follow each other to have tailored twotter feeds.

An image of the current website prototype is below:
